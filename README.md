# Project-News-Media

This notebook web-scrapes for article titles from India's top newspapers and saves them as csv files along with the their publishing dates.

Most of the headlines cover COVID-19 related news extensively, but in case the newspaper didn't cover COVID-19 related news extensively, I've visited the newspapers' "Coronavirus" section and scraped the top articles from there.

English newspapers:
<ul>
<li> The Times of India, India's largest selling newspaper
<li> The Hindu
<li> India Today
<li> The News' Minute, a website that provides short, 1-minute-readable news with primary focus on the <li> 5 southern Indian states
<li> Indian Express
</ul>
And then, specifically, 3 famous English newspapers in Andhra Pradesh:
<ul>
<li> Deccan Chronicle
<li> New Indian Express, Indian Express's southern counterpart
<li> The News Minute
</ul>

Sometimes the top headlines will be few in number, hence, the next set of top articles will have to be scraped for that day. Whenever I have felt the inadequacy of the number of titles, that newspaper has two functions defined for the number of top articles to exceed 10.
